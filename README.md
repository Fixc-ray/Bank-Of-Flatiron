# Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!

## Project Overview

This project is a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions and allows you to add new transactions. The application consumes a RESTful API provided by a `db.json` file and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Core Features

- **View Transactions:** The application displays a table of all transactions.
- **Add a Transaction:** Users can fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction. The transaction is then displayed in the table and persisted to the backend.

## Setup Instructions

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (for serving the `db.json` file as an API)
